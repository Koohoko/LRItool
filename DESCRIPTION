Title: Designing Flu LRI Mutants On LRIscan Results
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R: person("Haogao", "Gu", email = "hggu@connect.hku.hk", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: In order to study the effects of potential long-range RNA-RNA interaction(LRI)
    in Influenza A virus. We developed this project locating the LRI regions from the result 
    of LRIscan, moreover, we introduced silent mutations in target LRI regions to design 
    mutants of interest for further laboratory analysis.
